The goal (as I see it) is to write a short blog post to send out, and simultaneously a simple paper to submit to the arXiv with more details. The paper should include a description of the survey, our most robust result(s), a few survey lessons learned, and any action items for future meetings we can think of.

I am happy to take lead on writing, if people will help me finish up plots and calculating numbers.

Here are the list of action items:

- propgate final data.csv file in to plots/numbers
- measure (or at least understand) completeness by computing gender ratios for all talks given versus the talks we surveyed in this study
- consider the impact of the Session Chair's gender
- Find the sessions with the most even and most disparate gender ratios (for talks and questions)
- group talks in to broad subject catagories (even Planets versus everyone else would be interesting), which subjects do best/worst?
- update (and make pretty) the histograms and other plots
- do some more background reading on similar studies
  - useful numbers here:  http://www.aas.org/cswa/percent.html
- write paper
...
- profit!
