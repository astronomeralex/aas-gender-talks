QUESTIONS WE HAVE ON HOW PEOPLE REPORTED AND/OR THINGS TO DO BETTER: 
- Did people put down when the chair asked a question?  
- How do we account for non-binary gendered indivuals?
- For next time use options of: Male, Female, Chair, Non-binary
- Was the question clear that the "MMFM" should be in order the questions were asked?
- What do we do about repeat data? (For now, take longer string)
- Do we want to include gender ratio of intedees of the talks? 
- What is the bias of people who knew about this idea? Is there any? (Ie. what types of talks do they go to?)
